      "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Dhanesh joined the same organization in 2019 that applied for his Employment pass that year. The provided URL is his Weekday Works profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I navigated to the URL and extracted the text. Looking through the extracted text, I see his work history. Under the \"Experience\" section, it lists his roles. The latest entry is \"Manager at OCBC | Singapore 2021 - Present\". Before that, he was a Senior Software Developer at Equinix from 2020-2021, then a D API Engineer at DBS Bank from 2019-2020. Wait, the DBS Bank role is from 2019-2020. So in 2019, he was at DBS Bank. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Employment pass application. The user is asking if the organization that applied for his Employment pass in 2019 is the same as where he joined in 2019. The text mentions \"OCBC\" as his current employer, but in 2019 he was at DBS Bank. However, the Employment pass application would typically be for the employer at the time of application. Since he was working at DBS Bank in 2019, it's possible that DBS Bank applied for his Employment pass. But the question is whether he joined the same organization in 2019 that applied for the pass. Since he was already with DBS Bank in 2019, maybe the pass was for his employment there. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention the Employment pass details. The user might need more specific info, but based on the available data, the answer would be that he was at DBS Bank in 2019, so if the pass was for DBS Bank, then yes. But the answer should be based on the data extracted. Since the text doesn't mention the Employment pass, but the work history shows DBS Bank in 2019, the answer is that he joined DBS Bank in 2019, which might be the same as the organization that applied for his Employment pass that year. However, the text doesn't confirm the Employment pass details, so the answer is based on the work history.\n",
