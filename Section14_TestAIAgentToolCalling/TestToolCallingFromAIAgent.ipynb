Wait, cashback usually refers to getting a percentage back on the amount spent. So 10% of 20 is 2. So adding that back to the remaining 15, the total would be 15 + 2 = 17. Let me check if the tools available can handle this. The subtract_numbers tool can handle the initial subtraction. Then, to calculate the cashback, maybe multiply 20 by 10% (which is 0.10).

      "Okay, let's see. The user started with $35. They spent $20, so first I need to subtract 20 from 35. That would leave them with $15. But then there's a 10% cashback. Wait, cashback on the spent amount or the remaining? Usually, cashback is on the amount spent. So 10% of $20 is $2. So adding that back to the remaining $15 would give $17. Let me check the steps again. Subtract 20 from 35, then add 10% of 20. So 35 - 20 = 15, then 20 * 0.10 = 2. 15 + 2 = 17. So the final amount should be $17.\n",

      "Okay, so the user spent $20 and got a 10% cashback. I calculated the cashback as 10% of 20, which is $2. Now, I need to add that $2 back to the remaining money after the purchase. Earlier, subtracting $20 from $35 left them with $15. Adding the $2 cashback to $15 gives a total of $17. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps here. The cashback is on the spent amount, so it's correct to add 10% of 20 to the remaining 15. Yep, that seems right. So the final answer should be $17.\n",

Calculating 10% of 20 is $2. Adding that back to the $15 they had left after the purchase gives $17. So the final amount they have left is $17. I think that's correct. Let me double-check the calculations. 35 minus 20 is definitely 15. 10% of 20 is 2. Adding 15 and 2 gives 17. Yep, that all adds up. No steps seem missed here.
