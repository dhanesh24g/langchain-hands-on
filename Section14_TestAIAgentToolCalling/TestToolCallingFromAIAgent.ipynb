      "Wait, but the user might want the total after the raise. So the new salary is original plus 15% of original. So 9500 * 1.15. But since the tools don't have a direct percentage tool, maybe I can use multiply_numbers with 9500 and 1.15? Wait, the multiply tool's parameters are a and b, both numbers. So if I multiply 9500 by 1.15, that would give the same result as adding 15% of 9500 to the original. Let me verify. 9500 * 1.15 equals 9500 + (9500 * 0.15). So maybe that's a more efficient way. Let me check if that's allowed. The multiply_numbers tool allows a and b to be numbers, so 1.15 is acceptable. So perhaps I can use multiply_numbers with a=9500 and b=1.15. That would directly give the new salary. But wait, the user's question is about a 15% raise, which is adding 15% to the original. So yes, multiplying by 1.15 is correct. Let me confirm the calculation. 9500 * 1.15 equals 9500 * 1 + 9500 * 0.15 = 9500 + 1425 = 10925. So the new salary is $10,925. But the tools don't have a percentage tool, so I need to use multiply_numbers with 9500 and 1.15. Alternatively, calculate the 15% first and then add. Either way, the result is the same. Let me see if the tools allow for that. Since the multiply tool can take 1.15, maybe that's the better approach. So the action would be multiply_numbers with a=9500 and b=1.15. Then return the result as the final answer. Alternatively, if the tool requires integers, but the multiply tool's parameters are numbers, so decimals are allowed. So that should work.

Wait, cashback usually refers to getting a percentage back of the amount spent. So 10% of 20 is 2. So adding that back to the remaining 15 would give 15 + 2 = 17. So the final amount left should be $17. Let me check if I need to use any tools here. The tools available are add_numbers, subtract_numbers, and multiply_numbers. The subtraction and multiplication can be done with those tools. So first subtract 20 from 35 using subtract_numbers, then calculate 10% of 20 (which is 2) using multiply_numbers with 20 and 0.10, then add those results together.
