      "Okay, let's tackle the user's questions. First, they want to know the latest winner of the ICC Champions Trophy. Since the current year is 2025, I need to check the most recent tournament. The ICC Champions Trophy was last held in 2023, so maybe there's a 2024 or 2025 event. Wait, but the user mentioned 2025, so perhaps there's a new edition. I should use the Wikipedia tool to find the latest winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the user is asking about their salary after a 15% raise on $10K. That's a straightforward calculation. 15% of 10,000 is 1,500, so the new salary would be 11,500. I can use the add_numbers tool for this. But wait, the tools available are add, subtract, multiply, divide. So 10,000 plus 15% of 10,000. Alternatively, multiply 10,000 by 1.15. Maybe the multiply tool is better here. Let me confirm: 10,000 * 1.15 = 11,500. So using multiply_numbers with a=10000 and b=1.15.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user might have intended to add 15% as a separate step. However, since the tools don't have a percentage tool, using multiply is more efficient. So I'll handle the salary calculation with multiply_numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for the ICC Champions Trophy, I'll use the Wikipedia tool. The query should be \"ICC Champions Trophy 2025 winner\" or similar. Wait, but if the tournament hasn't happened yet in 2025, maybe the latest is 2023. Let me check the Wikipedia entry for the ICC Champions Trophy to find the most recent winner. The tool will provide the current information, so I'll use the query \"ICC Champions Trophy\" and look for the latest edition.\n",
